## 🎮 Game Modes

### 1. Normal Tic Tac Toe
- Classic 3x3 grid.
- Two players (X and O) take turns.
- First to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all squares are filled and no one wins, it's a tie.
- Animated win line and big win/tie message.

### 2. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
- The board is a 3x3 grid of 3x3 Tic Tac Toe boards (9 small boards in total).
- Players take turns as X and O.
- On your turn, you play in one of the 81 small squares.
- **The twist:** The cell you pick determines which small board your opponent must play in next. (E.g., if you play in the top-right cell of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-right small board next.)
- If a small board is already won or full, your opponent can play in any board.
- Win a small board by getting three in a row in that board.
- Win the whole game by winning three small boards in a row (like classic Tic Tac Toe, but with boards!).
- Visual turn indicator, active board highlighting, animated win lines, and big win/tie message.

## 📚 About Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a strategic twist on the classic game. Instead of a single 3x3 board, you play on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 boards. Each move determines where your opponent must play next, adding layers of strategy and planning. The goal is to win three small boards in a row, just like classic Tic Tac Toe, but with much more depth!
